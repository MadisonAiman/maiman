They're either A ) not educated enough of the reality that they're being ruthlessly stolen from at every step of the way (broker, market maker, DTCC, etc) B) paid off to say things C) afraid of tax consequences I see people make arguments for "the broker shares are the MOASS shares" and "you really think a broker will lose your shares or not honour them..? Come on bro" I mean, if an entire nation can go bankrupt and take their people's money, why wouldn't a broker or bank be able to? I dunno, I just don't trust it. Why subject yourself to PFOF, FTDs, stock lending, not voting your shares? You buy something, you should get it no? üü£

Agreed. And on the broker side don‚Äôt forget the vast number of brokers whom shut off the buy button. That alone should be enough to encourage drsing; but then you have all the other reasons on top of that. I just don‚Äôt get it. Anyways, back to the kids - ya know - cuz there are too many.

Good luck. I'm not going to risk losing my shares during MOASS, it could be tomorrow. Especially if everyone decided to just buy from Computershare instead of a brokerage while APEs at brokerages DRS. If more shares leave the DTCC than go in, I would image that would lead to efficient price discovery.

Welcome those of you from the front page. Intermediary in this sense means Stock Broker like Fidelity, Vanguard, etc. There are many transfer agents. Computershare is the transfer agent for GameStop (GME). GameStop's stock, GME, is the primary focus of this sub. Buying stock directly from the transfer agent hits the lit market, bypasses the brokers, and registers the stock in your name. Stock purchased through brokers is not actually held in your name, might not come from the lit market, may be purchased from dark pools, or may just be counterfeit shares entirely. Transferring your shares from a broker to the transfer agent ensures that even shares that was originally counterfeit are real and registered in your name.

Let's rephrase that one big chief. It absolutely matters if you DRS after buying via Fidelity. It's *better* to buy direct from CS but let's absolutely universally unequivocally **refrain** from dissuading people to DRS shares bought elsewhere. Doing so gives the hedge funds a little more oxygen to stay alive a little longer, but they are going to be shot with a bazooka once the float is locked up anyways so any way you can acquire shares and DRS them is fine. DRS and lock the float is, and always will be, the play. Buying direct from CS is, again, always better but if you can't do that or don't want to move your money around to do so, buying from brokers and DRSing is still perfectly fine. Not financial advice

Buying form a broker actually gives you more control on the purchase price (using limit orders), with computershare you unfortunately do not have this option (you front up the funds and wait around 2 days for them to execute). In the end, so long as broker shares are DRS‚Äôd then the result is the same (give or take a few shares depending on the purchase price at time of execution) In my view the most effective purchase route is through a broker using IEX (with an order of 100 shares or more to actually have a chance of moving the price) and the DRS‚Äôing right after trade settlement. All routes point to DRS.. each of us can decide how to reach that point if we so wish

I guess neither does Dr. Trimbath because that's specifically what she said in the tweet. "Like any Ponzi Scheme: they keep working as long as new money is coming in. When investors (you) insist on buying shares directly from issuers (Gamestop/Computershare), without intermediaries (Fidelity, TDAmeritrade, any broker, etc), the music stops." If you use an intermediary, you're just giving them more chairs to play with. Even if you eventually take the chair away, they still got to use it to delay being eliminated. So yea, keep buying from Fudelity and keep giving them more time with the music. Again. NFA. Just my opinion.

The music stops when the float is locked you goober. Nothing they do can delay that. If you think otherwise, feel free to elaborate *exactly* how buying through a broker will prevent MOASS after the float is locked.

We know we need to direct register our shares to protect our investment. But maybe Dr. T is right. Maybe brokerages are somehow using new shares to reset FTDs? I'm not sure, but I think Dr. T chose her words carefully. I think I might actually only buy from CS from now on. If no new shares go in, and shares only come out, maybe that's the balance that needs to be upset?

So you're saying the new shares can somehow reset FTDs, and if retail only buys from the issuer, the brokerage will get the money yes, but not the "fresh shares" that could be used for fukery? Basically, buy straight from Computershare if you want efficient price discovery.

If it's a direct purchase make sure you have at least 1 shared transferred from a broker, a better than average one of possible.

i think it stems from a misunderstood attempt by my canadian credit union to try and set up an american account for me so I could buy directly, this was 84 years ago before i got wise. so my credit union was trying to help me, it didn't work out, and computershare is thinking there might be shenanigans at hand. That's my best guess as they won't tell me anything about the error. i've explained many times to the phone room, i have emailed, i have submitted the online forms, i have complied with all their requests but i still can't continue investing through Computershare, according to my last contact. it's not like we're talking big numbers here either, i buy in single digits if/when i can.

ka-chow! ...update: I got a reply from the Ombudsman in Canada and they're willing to look into it, peerhaps since Computershare is also a 'participant' in Canada? So I sent another email query to CS about my account and waiting to hear back, if I get nothing in a week I'll forward all communications to Ombudsman and see where to go from there. EDIT: update! It seems mentioning the magic word "Ombudsman" might have helped, as I just got an email from CS's "financial crimes" division saying the locks on my accounts have been removed. I decided to test this statement this morning by putting a direct buy order in and so far so good! Next up will be DRS'ing the remainder of shares I accumulated at my Shitty Broker while all this was going on. So, lesson learned is: perseverance furthers, and Ombudsmen seem to get respect. I just wish Computershare's customer-facing service was a little more willing to work with problems and less "sorry I can't help you and can't forward you to someone who can.", it shouldn't take months to get to an email exchange that can make any progress.
