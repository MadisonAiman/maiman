ACTUALLY the penguin, is a millionaire, (I assume Ras Al Ghul et al are too) and I'd assume many others would be pretty well off too, if they weren't genetic freaks with a bone to pick with society. I mean I wouldn't call the majority of his villains poor, they don't do villainy for lack of money.

The main villains aren't mostly poor, for sure. But much of the lore of Batman is the "crime fighting" that involved stopping petty theft and robberies via some pretty extreme vigilante brutality. Crimes that real-world experience has shown to be almost exclusively caused by poverty, which is best resolved via poverty relief and social programs, not senseless beatings (which will continue until morale improves, of course). That doesn't make for great storytelling though.

That sounds real similar to the shit conservatives say about big cities like Chicago and NYC...almost like comics are an artistic satire of life. The reality is that Wayne is a billionaire spending an untold fortune on boondoggles to enact personal revenge on a charicature of the guy who killed his parents. His whole fortune comes from the work of people who aren't him. Most of the villians he fights wouldn't be able to find minions if the people of the city had either enough stable and livable jobs to avoid the risk of crime, and weren't beaten senseless, enforcing a circle of solving problems via violence, or just recieved enough assistance to not need to resort to petty theft. Bruce Wayne is a villian. He doesn't fix Gotham because he doesn't want to - if he does, he has to come to terms with the fact that his parents and he contributed to the system that created their killer in the first place. Don't get me wrong, the other villains are villains as well, but they're created by the system that Wayne wants to remain in place.

A new class of 150,000+ apes. I am sure a good chunk of them will be very interested in getting involved in our institutions (local governments, state governments, federal governments, media, etc). Also many will have interest in taking serious legal action against many of these institutions and individuals. Our world has a very deeply rooted corruption/greed/tyranny problem. However, a bunch of good men/women with major ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù money, could change the world.

Do you not understand how much stock they also own? Hell, at the top they get a commission or percentage on every trade. There's no way you can catch them like this. Getting enough money to be solvent and free of wage based servitude is DELIGHTFUL, but the top is still the top and unless you exploit thousands of your employees you'll probably never see it.

Hijacking this comment to ~~add~~ *correct* the D man. He said stock *split* when it's actually a stock dividend. We will be receiving new shares, not splitting the shares we already have. That is an important distinction when it comes to fucking hedgies! Read this to grow wrinkles. https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vt25zf/stop_saying_its_a_41_split_its_a_41_dividend_this/

7 is a truly magical number, just as the number 3 is so "perfect". What is interesting to me is that 741 is not a prime number, so it must have been alluded to from the very beginning to be a split you didn't think was coming until you really thought about it. I dunno. I'm rambling after work sucked me dry.
