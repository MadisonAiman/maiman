"Attack specific person" is standardized short seller strategy. They try to create animosity towards an individual so they can use that to generalize the animosity towards a company. It worked really well with tesla shorting for a whole decade using a certain polarizing individual as their hatred target, so those companies made the practice standard. Now, when you're not sure if a TV personality is paid for FUD, just wait a few minutes and see if they go after a specific individual to try and skew that slant towards a company. That's confirmation they're paid by shorts and following the standard practice. I assume this is why both RC and DFV managed to stay quiet for so long, and communications had been generally vague so as to make short stories harder to write.

Anyone who posted good DD has been threatened into silence. Mods were paid off and threatened and forced to go into silence.

Cats are sneaky! DFV is not sneaky, DFV wouldn’t have doubled down and sold if he was a sneaky cat trying to manipulate a long position for himself and screw with other investors. Like the big “ Fat Cats” of wallstreet DFV wants us to hang in there because the stock we like has risen again like using a quick revive on a fallen ally, and come back stronger than before after buffing up stats to destroy the big baddie at the end of the game.

I mean, it's definitely possible... But the dude bought MORE and the price hasn't gone up all that much since his last buy. His nickname was DeepFuckingValue, and his investment strategy was pretty long term from what I understand. "No precise target, just up." is what his mentality was for this stock. I doubt he sold but it's definitely not impossible. Looking at your post history from the meltdown sub and ballstreetwets, I see you posting things like this: >these fucks will be talking their conspiracy BS for at least another three years. Uh huh. I'm all for an open discussion, but it seems you have your mind made up already. Too bad, there's far more evidence that things are very very manipulated than not, but to call it a "conspiracy BS" means you either haven't read and done your research or you're a shill. Oh well. Good luck Chad.

> has $35,000,000. Posts "final update". Never posts again. Surely he must be lurking in the background risking it on stupid options bets instead of sitting back and enjoying his new found wealth. I'm sure he's also not spending a tonne on private security for when the cult he accidentally formed collapses and someone tries to shoot him because they've trashed all their relationships, lost all their money and ruined their lives.

I think he made his investment work for him and he prolly has a average cost of about 0 dollars.

While that’s probably true, he was not RC’s only option. RC could have talked to anyone. With how tonfoily this sub can get, it’s surprising I haven’t seen anyone suggest maybe we should dig through the rest of his content in the event there’s something that’s not rehypothecated info from here (which is unlikely but possible). I’d be a fool to say that there’s no way that RC and his team, especially legal, didn’t look into this dude before they offered an interview. Either way, nothing changes in my book. I like the stock and I’ll keep buying and hodling.

Then the big swingin' dicked, mother fuckin sick fucked-up mother fucker proceeded to buy 50,000 more shares at $38ish ($9.50 post split) putting him at 150,000 shares. . . Are ya done yet? Nope. Here comes DFV with the steel chair, 50,000 more shares at $144ish ($36ish post splivy)!!!!!!!!!! Bah Gawd that's DFV with 200,000 (800,000 after split) shares of GME. Holding the championship belt and the intercontinental title simultaneously. P.S. I'd be willing to bet he has added more!!!! P.S.S. Imagine if somehow he knew the cycles and added a few million more shares through options. The only way the most awarded post in Reddit history gets overshadowed. . . .
