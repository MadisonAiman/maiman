It’s not because of the media. It is because the way the game is played. No one has to protect “retail investors” nor “apes” but their is a fiduciary due to protect household investors. My wife’s boyfriend said it was fine to be an ape on a subreddit, but if real change is to come, HOUSEHOLD investors need to take the bananas out of our asses (still fucking legendary) and start using the correct terminology to be taken seriously. Again, in this space, I love the crazy, but on the bird app and other more “serious” subs dedicated to GME, using the correct terms will signal to all parties that the “apes” got wrinkles and aren’t fucking around.

You know I learned a good deal about being stereotyped growing up and I realized something while in the marines. The person being stereotyped has nothing to do with the actual stereotype because the person who is stereotyping will view them through a narrow orbs regardless of what they do. They see retail as dumb money regardless of what they call themselves or however they carry themselves if you’re not in their club or with them they see you are dumb money. It’s not dumb money because the people are “dumb” it’s because to them they are marks they are being conned to the extent that they are conning themselves “here take my money” meme Is it a good look to look and appear informed , of course it’s better than the other option but does it matter when regardless we are all in the same boat??

Legally speaking, yes, it matters. Example A: I was shoved by two men who called me a bitch and said they were gonna kick my ass. Example B: Two men assaulted me and threatened me. Example A is how you’d tell the story to your friends (this sub). Example B is how you’d say it to a judge/jury. I get it; we aren’t in their club. But Dr. T has helped many people here gain some wrinkles and even though I don’t agree with everything she says, the truth is, she’s got a PhD on the subject and can articulate (in the most legally binding way) the GME saga.

I’m sorry but that’s pure conjecture to the borderline of being flawed logic: false equivalence (those two situations doesn’t capture the essence of each other. moving the goalpost: (Your position changed to “Legally speaking” after challenged) Appeal to authority: (Just because she is an expert doesn’t mean someone who’s not an expert cannot explain it just as well as she can. KG is an expert who can manipulate the facts of his actions but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t committed crimes. This is the exact problem here! Regardless of who can articulate it better or who knows what the appeal to authority needs to die.) While it is true that the way a story is presented can affect its reception and in a legal settings, presenting facts accurately and objectively is important, it does not negate the significance of stereotypes or the impact of one's presentation in other contexts.(false equivalence) someone who is stereotyped as something have a highly likelihood of being judged or perceived as that regardless of their actions. Euphemisms for retail investor doesn’t matter it all essentially means the same thing however it is just professional to present it in one way depending on the context and legally the presentation matters only as much as the context and words assuming you have representation and can play their game. No one would go in court and say dumb money they would say retail but as I pointed out legality wasn’t in your original argument See the case of the Amazon Union and how that guy presents himself in a legal setting And to be honest, you’re wrong. Information is often presented as example A in court because they want the exact occurrence of what happened instead of vague option b. You give them way too much power

Funny, your description of ape was what I always took it as. I don't know when/where I first heard "all people equal" (maybe one of the first "docs" that came out), but I was like "THAT'S what it means?" And I thought I stood corrected. And I always liked the other description better - the meta humor of adopting the idiot role the media depicted - and it just makes more sense to me. So I appreciate your comment because I thought I was just mistaken early on, 84 years ago.

And that's exactly the point in the game that we are at. In general terms, Its been going on long enough that we start to forget details of this or that. As we forget those details their narrative can start to take root and twist our memory. Hence why Its important to brush up on the old DD, and to have confidence in your own perception of everything going on. Hard to call out bullshit when you arent confident in your knowledge

Lets be honest, there's lots of things here that arent the best first impression. Reality is, not everyone will be drawn into this. We'll also never get represented in corporate media regardless of how we present, so who gives a shit? Stick with what made us, us, and mock the fuck out of corporate media while we're at it. To be clear, I'm only talking about discussion and whatever HERE in our space. In real life and other situations, yes, a professional approach would be much better.

Dr T is a lot of terrific things. Shes full of wonderful insights to market structure and a tremendous advocate for a lot of the same fight against wall street that we all are engaged in. She, however, is NOT an authority or knowledgeable on the nuance of why ape was chosen in the first place or what it actually meant when this all kicked off (and what I feel it should still signify). Ape does not have some larger meaning beyond us all being regarded "dumb money" throwing our savings at a stonk we all have individually decided is worth our support. All people equal is 100% a retcon by the media and popcorn stock. That was never what ape meant. Ape was OUR moniker that WE collectively chose. It was chosen BECAUSE it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek ws-bets humor. Same as "what sell button, I cant read, just know buy". It was chosen to make fun of the wall street/corporate media narrative of "dumb" retail money. It's sarcasm/mocking of the highest order directed at media. To attempt to distance ourselves from the term because of the MEDIA? FUCK THAT. That's a complete betrayal of what this movement stands for.

I agree, but I think honestly the media would always find a derogatory term for us. If we hadn't labelled ourselves as apes, they would just refer to us as "reddit investors" or something like that. Something - anything - to delegitimize us. That's their job their owners give them, and they're going to do it no matter what. At least this way, we make it fun.

Just like when everyone got so butthurt by that SEC commercial slamming meme stocks and empty speculation. Gme never was a meme stock. The SEC knew that and put a report out on how gme is no fluke and poses an idiosyncratic risk due to market maker abuse.

Because people deep in GME are not doing what the grand group of people called ”household investors” do. Household investors are complacent farmstock for banks and brokers to abuse and make money on. The whole idea here is *not to be a fucking farm animal for financial criminals.* And you want to identify us as the most sheepish, useless, abused group of investors there is? And ape doesn’t come from copying, it comes from the memes derived of Planet of the Apes where they overthrow the shitty old system.

The name sort of matters. I mean not really. Whether they call me a meme, retail, or household investor, it doesn’t change that I made a logical decision based on peer-reviewed due diligence to invest in a company with hardly any debt, and huge future prospects. The more they name call, the more it exposes them. I prefer household investor, but they won’t take us seriously no matter what name they give us. It takes money to buy whiskey. My kids will call me Household Diamond hands, their kids will ask what happened to their trust funds. These criminals can say whatever they want for now :) I get that it’d be nice if MSM didn’t encourage their narrative, but the greatest transfer of wealth in history wasn’t just going to be handed to us

NO. That is NOT the origin of ape. That is a retcon by the media to help hedgies and wall street divide up our money to their other tickers so less money flows into GME. Ape was originally 10000% bets humor making fun of wallstreet referring to retail investors as "dumb money". As in "I'm just a crayon eating ape chasing 'nanas and tendies to shove up my ass, oops I just bought more GME". That's it. There was never any larger unifying message in the term "ape". This shit isnt complicated and never was. Simply tongue in cheek making fun of wall street and the media. People attempting to get away from that is fucking sad to see.

There are overlaps between what she wants and what individual investors want. She is a proponent of change, as many people on this sub are as well. So is D Lauer. However, someone I don’t see on this sub, or hear about on the ledger is DFV. I think he started the movement, but I don’t think he is a part of it anymore. He should not be held in such high regard. It sucks to hear, but unless someone can prove that he’s still an activist, then it should be assumed he cashed out understandably.
