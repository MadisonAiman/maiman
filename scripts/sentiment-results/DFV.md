this is the craziest, most confirmation bias inducing thing. This is his final YOLO update, yes, but he just fucking doubled down. he not only excercised calls, but he bought $8million dollars more in shares than he already had. WHY the fuck would he do that unless he had total fucking confidence that this thing was going to skyrocket. thikn about it. put an extra $8million dollars at risk of declining when he's aready a multi millionaire? he has to know something we don't know (or do know and we've been tracking this shit properly the whole time!). His tweets today had the theme of the big short, taking down financial institutions, taking off with big money. I just have to think... he added more to his position not because he's unsure about what happens next, but that he's 1000% confident that this rocket ship is lifting off. someone pointed out earlier that this is the same guy that is batting 1.000. meaning, he impossibly but confidently has already beating all of the odds as though he's a time traveler and knows what happens next. He got in at what, the all time bottom of $3/$4? timed the January top to sell some shares (calls?) held a position and at the time of the trial doubled down his position at the absolute bottom.... and NOW he's doubled his position again? holy shit.

The man is a master of memes, for the past week people were wondering if the # of tweets were a countdown, count up, if minutes between was significant, etc. If this is accurate 69/420, the man has forethought, planning and conviction unlike anyone I have ever seen before. It is truly incredible!

He held when they hit 50 million, he held when they hit 17 million and he exercised and bought more when they at 34 million. There is an argument that he cannot lose for how cheap he got in but it speaks to the legend that he held and recommitted several times throughout the GME saga. Truly amazing.

Oh, he could definitely lose. I mean, it takes a 90% drop to erase a 1000% gain. He could theoretically see millions of dollars evaporate. But his dimond balls and doubling down tells me: confidence. And to my point, extreme confirmation bias.

Thats more optimistic than my figuring I was thinking $640ps w/in 4years by looking at chewy and consolidating their current share price into a similar # of shares. At a share avg of what $60 max that's a guaranteed 10x a fucking grandslam in the world series. this squeeze goes off he be the fucking God Emperor of the fucking universe. 10m is not a meme means he'll blow the fucking doors off of being the first trillionair he'll be the richest Liquid assets mofo after taxes, likely to never be touched by any single person, and blackrock will own the planet if they sell at 10m. Most of us will be top 2-3% in comparison. the only way I see this doesn't zero out the world is if USD goes .001 or less of current value so ^hodl ^like ^your ^fucking ^lives ^depend ^on ^it ^cause ^it ^might we might be heading for crazy conspiracy land post squeeze, and God knows the only thing governments respect is fuckin dollar bills y'all.
