There are two different statements: In reference to GME, he was asked why Furlong was placed as CEO instead of himself. He said he had done that sort of work at Chewy, and wasn’t interested in putting in the time into a single company like that again with his kids/family. Instead he likes to play a higher/advisory role and let Furlong do his thing. In reference to towel, he said he did not want to be on the board directly but wanted his representation there given he was busy with GME.
