ncory32 commented at 06/15/2023, 08:54:41 248 : Dr T is a lot of terrific things. Shes full of wonderful insights to market structure and a tremendous advocate for a lot of the same fight against wall street that we all are engaged in. She, however, is NOT an authority or knowledgeable on the nuance of why ape was chosen in the first place or what it actually meant when this all kicked off (and what I feel it should still signify). Ape does not have some larger meaning beyond us all being regarded "dumb money" throwing our savings at a stonk we all have individually decided is worth our support. All people equal is 100% a retcon by the media and popcorn stock. That was never what ape meant. 

Ape was OUR moniker that WE collectively chose. It was chosen BECAUSE it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek ws-bets humor. Same as "what sell button, I cant read, just know buy". It was chosen to make fun of the wall street/corporate media narrative of "dumb" retail money. It's sarcasm/mocking of the highest order directed at media. To attempt to distance ourselves from the term because of the MEDIA? FUCK THAT. That's a complete betrayal of what this movement stands for.

usriusclark replied to ncory32 at 06/15/2023, 11:47:52 36 : It‚Äôs not because of the media. It is because the way the game is played. No one has to protect ‚Äúretail investors‚Äù nor ‚Äúapes‚Äù but their is a fiduciary due to protect household investors. 


My wife‚Äôs boyfriend said it was fine to be an ape on a subreddit, but if real change is to come, HOUSEHOLD investors need to take the bananas out of our asses (still fucking legendary) and start using the correct terminology to be taken seriously. 


Again, in this space, I love the crazy, but on the bird app and other more ‚Äúserious‚Äù subs dedicated to GME, using the correct terms will signal to all parties that the ‚Äúapes‚Äù got wrinkles and aren‚Äôt fucking around.

Cycloptic_Floppycock replied to usriusclark at 06/15/2023, 13:06:03 22 : On superstonk, I talk smack, in real life, when people ask, I'm eloquent, paced, have facts and historical reference and take my time to explain succinctly without coming across as a banana stuffing regard a la Charlie with the strings meme. 

We are not the same.

[deleted user] replied to Cycloptic_Floppycock at 06/15/2023, 14:27:17 6 : Same!

ncory32 replied to Cycloptic_Floppycock at 06/15/2023, 15:55:43 3 : Exactly.

theshadowbudd replied to usriusclark at 06/16/2023, 03:14:08 3 : You know I learned a good deal about being stereotyped growing up and I realized something while in the marines.

The person being stereotyped has nothing to do with the actual stereotype because the person who is stereotyping will view them through a narrow orbs regardless of what they do. 

They see retail as dumb money regardless of what they call themselves or however they carry themselves if you‚Äôre not in their club or with them they see you are dumb money. It‚Äôs not dumb money because the people are ‚Äúdumb‚Äù it‚Äôs because to them they are marks they are being conned to the extent that they are conning themselves ‚Äúhere take my money‚Äù meme 

Is it a good look to look and appear informed , of course it‚Äôs better than the other option but does it matter when regardless we are all in the same boat??

usriusclark replied to theshadowbudd at 06/16/2023, 05:03:04 1 : Legally speaking, yes, it matters. 


Example A: I was shoved by two men who called me a bitch and said they were gonna kick my ass. 


Example B: Two men assaulted me and threatened me. 


Example A is how you‚Äôd tell the story to your friends (this sub). Example B is how you‚Äôd say it to a judge/jury. 


I get it; we aren‚Äôt in their club. But Dr. T has helped many people here gain some wrinkles and even though I don‚Äôt agree with everything she says, the truth is, she‚Äôs got a PhD on the subject and can articulate (in the most legally binding way) the GME saga.

theshadowbudd replied to usriusclark at 06/16/2023, 06:16:45 3 : I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs pure conjecture to the borderline of being flawed logic:
false equivalence (those two situations doesn‚Äôt capture the essence of each other. 

moving the goalpost:
(Your position changed to ‚ÄúLegally speaking‚Äù after challenged)

Appeal to authority:
(Just because she is an expert doesn‚Äôt mean someone who‚Äôs not an expert cannot explain it just as well as she can. KG is an expert who can manipulate the facts of his actions but that doesn‚Äôt mean he hasn‚Äôt committed crimes. This is the exact problem here! Regardless of who can articulate it better or who knows what the appeal to authority needs to die.) 

While it is true that the way a story is presented can affect its reception and in a legal settings, presenting facts accurately and objectively is important, it does not negate the significance of stereotypes or the impact of one's presentation in other contexts.(false equivalence) someone who is stereotyped as something have a highly likelihood of being judged or perceived as that regardless of their actions. 

Euphemisms for retail investor doesn‚Äôt matter it all essentially means the same thing however it is just professional to present it in one way depending on the context and legally the presentation matters only as much as the context and words assuming you have representation and can play their game. No one would go in court and say dumb money they would say retail but as I pointed out legality wasn‚Äôt in your original argument 

See the case of the Amazon Union and how that guy presents himself in a legal setting 

And to be honest, you‚Äôre wrong. Information is often presented as example A in court because they want the exact occurrence of what happened instead of vague option b. You give them way too much power

forbiddendoughnut replied to ncory32 at 06/15/2023, 15:23:16 6 : Funny, your description of ape was what I always took it as. I don't know when/where I first heard "all people equal" (maybe one of the first "docs" that came out), but I was like "THAT'S what it means?" And I thought I stood corrected. And I always liked the other description better - the meta humor of adopting the idiot role the media depicted - and it just makes more sense to me. So I appreciate your comment because I thought I was just mistaken early on, 84 years ago.

ncory32 replied to forbiddendoughnut at 06/15/2023, 15:50:00 3 : And that's exactly the point in the game that we are at. In general terms, Its been going on long enough that we start to forget details of this or that. As we forget those details their narrative can start to take root and twist our memory. Hence why Its important to brush up on the old DD, and to have confidence in your own perception of everything going on. Hard to call out bullshit when you arent confident in your knowledge

Dampmaskin replied to ncory32 at 06/15/2023, 10:52:15 5 : Also, it is technically correct.

Behind the tongue in cheek self jabs it‚Äôs a group of committed people fighting injustice and some damn wrinkly brains.

greg19735 replied to ncory32 at 06/15/2023, 15:08:18 2 : just because the investors here chose it doesn't mean it's a good thing for perception.

ncory32 replied to greg19735 at 06/15/2023, 15:54:52 2 : Lets be honest, there's lots of things here that arent the best first impression. Reality is, not everyone will be drawn into this. We'll also never get represented in corporate media regardless of how we present, so who gives a shit? Stick with what made us, us, and mock the fuck out of corporate media while we're at it. To be clear, I'm only talking about discussion and whatever HERE in our space. In real life and other situations, yes, a professional approach would be much better.

canigetahint replied to ncory32 at 06/16/2023, 11:59:53 1 : I remember those days...  Seems so long ago now.  Can't even recount how many different subs we've crossed into to at this point.  LOL

Dr. T has been calling it like it is for the past few weeks especially.  Queen Kong has spoken, but ye must remember, we apes bestowed that name upon her. 

We aren't meme, but we are damn sure smooth-brained, crayon eating apes!  

As apes used to chant:

"Ook ook motherfuckers!"

seronami commented at 06/15/2023, 07:46:51 162 : I feel like that is one thing that hurts us. We refer to ourselves as apes, diamond hands, and not household investors. It makes it easier for the news to ignore us or make us a joke. if we started calling us what we actually are, household investors, we would be taken more seriously.

Thulis replied to seronami at 06/15/2023, 07:57:34 117 : I agree, but I think honestly the media would always find a derogatory term for us.  If we hadn't labelled ourselves as apes, they would just refer to us as "reddit investors" or something like that.  Something - anything - to delegitimize us.  That's their job their owners give them, and they're going to do it no matter what.  

At least this way, we make it fun.

stonka_truck replied to Thulis at 06/15/2023, 08:38:46 28 : The "reddit mob" has been said on msm a few times if I'm not mistaken

floodmayhem replied to seronami at 06/15/2023, 08:38:03 9 : Just like when everyone got so butthurt by that SEC commercial slamming meme stocks and empty speculation.

Gme never was a meme stock.

The SEC knew that and put a report out on how gme is no fluke and poses an idiosyncratic risk due to market maker abuse.

Just like when someone throws an insult at you, you have no reason to be offended if it isn't true.

gamma55 replied to seronami at 06/15/2023, 08:57:58 3 : Because people deep in GME are not doing what the grand group of people called ‚Äùhousehold investors‚Äù do.

Household investors are complacent farmstock for banks and brokers to abuse and make money on. The whole idea here is *not to be a fucking farm animal for financial criminals.*

And you want to identify us as the most sheepish, useless, abused group of investors there is?

And ape doesn‚Äôt come from copying, it comes from the memes derived of Planet of the Apes where they overthrow the shitty old system.

skybleed replied to seronami at 06/15/2023, 09:26:54 8 : There was a reason for being called Apes which I feel that people forget. It had to do with bears and bulls. Apes were neither, with a crazy grip strength. Never selling.

[deleted user] replied to seronami at 06/15/2023, 08:04:16 8 : The name sort of matters. I mean not really. Whether they call me a meme, retail, or household investor, it doesn‚Äôt change that I made a logical decision based on peer-reviewed due diligence to invest in a company with hardly any debt, and huge future prospects. The more they name call, the more it exposes them. I prefer household investor, but they won‚Äôt take us seriously no matter what name they give us. It takes money to buy whiskey. 

My kids will call me Household Diamond hands, their kids will ask what happened to their trust funds. These criminals can say whatever they want for now :)

I get that it‚Äôd be nice if MSM didn‚Äôt encourage their narrative, but the greatest transfer of wealth in history wasn‚Äôt just going to be handed to us

gimmethegold1 replied to seronami at 06/15/2023, 10:09:32 1 : Yeah the whole ape thing is super cringe and should be left to popcorn

_Awakened_Warrior_ replied to seronami at 06/15/2023, 08:32:03 -9 : Let's not forget the origin of "ape" = all people equal

ncory32 replied to _Awakened_Warrior_ at 06/15/2023, 08:41:52 10 : NO. That is NOT the origin of ape. That is a retcon by the media to help hedgies and wall street divide up our money to their other tickers so less money flows into GME. Ape was originally 10000% bets humor making fun of wallstreet referring to retail investors as "dumb money". As in "I'm just a crayon eating ape chasing 'nanas and tendies to shove up my ass, oops I just bought more GME". That's it. There was never any larger unifying message in the term "ape". This shit isnt complicated and never was. Simply tongue in cheek making fun of wall street and the media. People attempting to get away from that is fucking sad to see.

capn-redbeard-ahoy replied to _Awakened_Warrior_ at 06/15/2023, 08:38:52 8 : Incorrect

All people equal is a retcon spread by Runic Glory

The original reference was to Planet of the Apes

gamma55 replied to SayTheWord-Beans at 06/15/2023, 09:02:20 3 : She‚Äôs wrong tho.

Ape doesn‚Äôt come from copying, it comes from Planet of the Apes, and is used as a reversal on the power structure against the corrupt powers that currently exists.

We are still apes but we should refer to each other as HOUSEHOLD INVESTORS as opposed APES cause it takes away from our message to the public and finance system.
