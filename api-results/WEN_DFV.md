danieltv11 replied to jeremy1051 at 11/24/2022, 10:49:09 451 : Man I remember when people didn‚Äôt even know DFV was roaring kitty. We were young

lostlogictime replied to danieltv11 at 11/24/2022, 11:24:39 144 : Blew me away when we found that out.

Edit: 84 years ago

secret_rye replied to lostlogictime at 11/24/2022, 13:35:14 49 : And everyone tried to make it sound like a scandal

me_like_stonk replied to secret_rye at 11/24/2022, 13:39:35 22 : why?

DDFitz_ replied to me_like_stonk at 11/24/2022, 15:06:28 28 : Because his YouTube series on Gamestop was construed as financial advice intended to strengthen his long position.

smokinjoep82 replied to DDFitz_ at 11/24/2022, 16:14:50 32 : Best financial advice ever.

blackmage1582 replied to smokinjoep82 at 11/24/2022, 17:45:01 14 : fake news attempts to scandalize anything they've been outdone in presenting

mark-five replied to blackmage1582 at 11/24/2022, 19:58:55 10 : "Attack specific person" is standardized short seller strategy.  They try to create animosity towards an individual so they can use that to generalize the animosity towards a company.

It worked really well with tesla shorting for a whole decade using a certain polarizing individual as their hatred target, so those companies made the practice standard.  Now, when you're not sure if a TV personality is paid for FUD, just wait a few minutes and see if they go after a specific individual to try and skew that slant towards a company.  That's confirmation they're paid by shorts and following the standard practice.

I assume this is why both RC and DFV managed to stay quiet for so long, and communications had been generally vague so as to make short stories harder to write.

StanStare replied to mark-five at 11/25/2022, 05:01:50 6 : Legend.

‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs still in I‚Äôm still in‚Äù was probably the most commented thing on his YOLO updates and that upset certain people greatly‚Ä¶

mark-five replied to StanStare at 11/25/2022, 10:16:03 4 : When he went dark shills immediately started "He's out! ..." and you still see them repeat that today occasionally in response to IHSIISI

They were absolutely livid about DFV being both friendly and resolute.  They can't fight with cordial "Just up"

StanStare replied to mark-five at 11/25/2022, 10:20:12 3 : Haha! Yeah you‚Äôre right - it was a perfect start to this legendary story too

TutekTheLegend replied to danieltv11 at 11/24/2022, 16:11:10 23 : I remember being really confused thinking roaring kitty and DFV were different people and then that there was a hearing scheduled with a Keith gill person that I had never heard of.  It was a thunderbolt moment when I realized they were all one guy.

Even people like me who just have a little karma got reporter for suicide threats. I can only imagine what they have said to DFV. I guarantee you they billionaires have made it clear if he speaks about gme again, they will kill him

Ravokion commented at 11/24/2022, 08:50:20 695 : As far as I'm concerned,  no one can say this saga is over until DFV can talk openly again. Until then... buckle up.

[deleted user] replied to Ravokion at 11/24/2022, 09:54:38 362 : That's actually a pretty good metric I hadn't thought of. If DFV is quiet, things are still happening. 

Hey may NEVER speak on his old accounts again, but I'm sure he's out there, being not a cat.

RoyalOGKush replied to [deleted user] at 11/25/2022, 05:45:09 2 : Cats are sneaky! DFV is not sneaky, DFV wouldn‚Äôt have doubled down and sold if he was a sneaky cat trying to manipulate a long position for himself and screw with other investors. Like the big ‚Äú Fat Cats‚Äù of wallstreet

DFV wants us to hang in there because the stock we like has risen again like using a quick revive on a fallen ally, and come back stronger than before after buffing up stats to destroy the big baddie at the end of the game.

lostlogictime replied to [deleted user] at 11/24/2022, 11:34:50 26 : Working on Gamestop's social media team, no doubt. I've thought this a long time, and wish I could bet on the outcome. Someday, when the time is right, they will announce this. Wallstreet will die inside that day, in some small way.

[deleted user] replied to [deleted user] at 11/24/2022, 14:18:00 -9 : What if he has cashed out, is enjoying his money and is just a little scared of you guys now

[deleted user] replied to [deleted user] at 11/24/2022, 14:30:59 12 : I mean, it's definitely possible... But the dude bought MORE and the price hasn't gone up all that much since his last buy. 

His nickname was DeepFuckingValue, and his investment strategy was pretty long term from what I understand. "No precise target, just up." is what his mentality was for this stock. I doubt he sold but it's definitely not impossible.

Looking at your post history from the meltdown sub and ballstreetwets, I see you posting things like this:

>these fucks will be talking their conspiracy BS for at least another three years.

Uh huh.

I'm all for an open discussion, but it seems you have your mind made up already. Too bad, there's far more evidence that things are very very manipulated than not, but to call it a "conspiracy BS" means you either haven't read and done your research or you're a shill.

Oh well. Good luck Chad.

[deleted user] replied to [deleted user] at 11/24/2022, 14:51:47 -5 : > you either haven't read and done your research or you're a shill.

So the only two options are:

1) you are correct and I have not done my research
2) you are correct and I am a paid bad actor

I hope you don't treat your friends and family the same way on this topic.

Megetoppegaaende replied to [deleted user] at 11/24/2022, 16:08:09 2 : Why sell a position that can print money?

[deleted user] replied to Megetoppegaaende at 11/24/2022, 16:12:39 -2 : His last post had the price at $51 (post split). If he was still holding now, half his money is gone. That's the opposite of money printing.

Megetoppegaaende replied to [deleted user] at 11/24/2022, 16:18:20 1 : Ah, yes - because he would never understand how options work.. Do you know how many calls he can sell pre/postsplit with his 200k (800k) shares?

[deleted user] replied to Megetoppegaaende at 11/24/2022, 16:45:42 0 : > has $35,000,000. Posts "final update". Never posts again.

Surely he must be lurking in the background risking it on stupid options bets instead of sitting back and enjoying his new found wealth. 

I'm sure he's also not spending a tonne on private security for when the cult he accidentally formed collapses and someone tries to shoot him because they've trashed all their relationships, lost all their money and ruined their lives.

Megetoppegaaende replied to [deleted user] at 11/24/2022, 22:24:37 1 : so having accumulated a massive position that has been is slow decay for over a year and being very aware on how options work you really believe he ¬´sits back¬ª when he can earn 5-6 digits a month selling CC‚Äôs? I think he made his investment work for him and he prolly has a average cost of about 0 dollars.

Error4ohh4 commented at 11/24/2022, 08:36:26 285 : Corporate media would love to blame MOASS on DFV. DFV is too smart to give them anything(hence his long-standing silence).

i_fear_you_do_now replied to Error4ohh4 at 11/24/2022, 11:16:34 79 : Kind of sad for him because he loved posting back in the day and put so much time and effort into his youtube channel. Must be strange for him to not be able to do that anymore for being  so darn good at it. I hope he finds solace in following other passions etc

[deleted user] replied to i_fear_you_do_now at 11/24/2022, 14:46:44 26 : I‚Äôll bet he posts here anon but no one really listens lmao

objectionkat replied to i_fear_you_do_now at 11/24/2022, 11:48:51 20 : How amazing would it be if he was making posts every day, along with us and our tinfoil hats, and is saving them for release when he is free to talk

PerfectHandle replied to uprclass2002 at 11/24/2022, 10:10:03 14 : While that‚Äôs probably true, he was not RC‚Äôs only option. RC could have talked to anyone. 

With how tonfoily this sub can get, it‚Äôs surprising I haven‚Äôt seen anyone suggest maybe we should dig through the rest of his content in the event there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs not rehypothecated info from here (which is unlikely but possible). 

I‚Äôd be a fool to say that there‚Äôs no way that RC and his team, especially legal, didn‚Äôt look into this dude before they offered an interview. Either way, nothing changes in my book. I like the stock and I‚Äôll keep buying and hodling.

meatcrobe replied to PerfectHandle at 11/24/2022, 12:00:09 4 : Yeah, why would RC chose him for an interview at all if not for a meaning. Not cohincidence. Well intended. 1k subscribers...

iHateRedditButImHere replied to PerfectHandle at 11/24/2022, 15:37:38 4 : I didn't like how he mentioned the street sub that has nothing to do with RC or GME

cagreene replied to uprclass2002 at 11/24/2022, 18:37:14 3 : You wouldn‚Äôt do the same? Just seeing as you/we/me would refer to him as ‚Äúthis guy‚Äù, he‚Äôs just another dude who has to survive at the end of the day. So he capitalized on it lol. I don‚Äôt blame him.

uprclass2002 replied to cagreene at 11/24/2022, 18:49:27 2 : Not at all, to be completely honest.  Monetizing off the situation doesn't seem right.  I'll do an interview with RC anytime without the need to monetize.  Nothing against him, I liked the interview, and he seems like a nice enough guy.

cagreene replied to uprclass2002 at 11/24/2022, 18:54:58 3 : Exactly. We‚Äôre all diff. I don‚Äôt blame him for lookin out for himself. He‚Äôll be forgotten eventually( like us all. Get the bag.

YouGotTheWrongGuy_9 commented at 11/24/2022, 09:40:39 174 : He said it was always a long play. Dude coulda cashed out and walked away. Instead he exercised his options and fucking HELD. Then the big swingin' dicked, mother fuckin sick fucked-up mother fucker proceeded to buy 50,000 more shares at $38ish ($9.50 post split) putting him at 150,000 shares. . . Are ya done yet? Nope. Here comes DFV with the steel chair, 50,000 more shares at $144ish ($36ish post splivy)!!!!!!!!!!

Bah Gawd that's DFV with 200,000 (800,000 after split) shares of GME. Holding the championship belt and the intercontinental title simultaneously.

P.S. I'd be willing to bet he has added more!!!!

P.S.S. Imagine if somehow he knew the cycles and added a few million more shares through options.

The only way the most awarded post in Reddit history gets overshadowed. . . .
