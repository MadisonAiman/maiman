noyogapants replied to turtleswag69 at 07/06/2022, 14:45:41 1435 : Same. The price isn't going up fast enough for me to be excited yet... Good news, but I'll temper my expectations for now.

WezGunz replied to noyogapants at 07/06/2022, 15:31:20 131 : You should not forget a lot of people dumped the apps on which they bought pre and after markets….. in January 21 people were buying a shitload of shares pre and after market as well

vistlip95 replied to noyogapants at 07/06/2022, 16:29:37 438 : When everyone is shouting about millions per share. Nothing right now is even remotely close for you to feel a pinch of excitement.

LarryLovesteinLovin replied to vistlip95 at 07/07/2022, 05:56:19 0 : Only question is whether millions is actually real or just a thing we like to pretend is real.

Ren0x11 replied to turtleswag69 at 07/06/2022, 15:30:40 640 : Same. Wake me up when I have enough money to tell my wife we’re finally no longer wage slaves, she can quit her grueling healthcare job, and I have “fuck you” levels of money to go after every single evil parasite fucker that has been destroying the lives of millions of regular people over the last 50 years. Justice shall be served one way or another.

TheRustyBird replied to Ren0x11 at 07/06/2022, 15:59:24 75 : So you want to become batman, but to beatup billionaires instead of poor people?

KakelaTron replied to TheRustyBird at 07/06/2022, 18:04:00 13 : Yeah! Like, like robinhood, but like... not, you know?

Interesting-Chest-75 replied to TheRustyBird at 07/06/2022, 23:04:19 4 : but batman also beats up billionaires.

delusions- replied to TheRustyBird at 07/06/2022, 17:45:04 2 : ACTUALLY the penguin, is a millionaire, (I assume Ras Al Ghul et al are too) and I'd assume many others would be pretty well off too, if they weren't genetic freaks with a bone to pick with society. I mean I wouldn't call the majority of his villains poor, they don't do villainy for lack of money.

Rhowryn replied to delusions- at 07/06/2022, 20:38:02 5 : The main villains aren't mostly poor, for sure. But much of the lore of Batman is the "crime fighting" that involved stopping petty theft and robberies via some pretty extreme vigilante brutality. Crimes that real-world experience has shown to be almost exclusively caused by poverty, which is best resolved via poverty relief and social programs, not senseless beatings (which will continue until morale improves, of course). That doesn't make for great storytelling though.

IALWAYSGETMYMAN replied to Rhowryn at 07/06/2022, 21:41:05 2 : Right but batman does invest in social programs all the time as Bruce through Wayne enterprises.  The issue is that Gotham is a cursed city unable to escape its own corruption.

Rhowryn replied to IALWAYSGETMYMAN at 07/07/2022, 00:11:52 1 : That sounds real similar to the shit conservatives say about big cities like Chicago and NYC...almost like comics are an artistic satire of life.

The reality is that Wayne is a billionaire spending an untold fortune on boondoggles to enact personal revenge on a charicature of the guy who killed his parents. His whole fortune comes from the work of people who aren't him. Most of the villians he fights wouldn't be able to find minions if the people of the city had either enough stable and livable jobs to avoid the risk of crime, and weren't beaten senseless, enforcing a circle of solving problems via violence, or just recieved enough assistance to not need to resort to petty theft.

Bruce Wayne is a villian. He doesn't fix Gotham because he doesn't want to - if he does, he has to come to terms with the fact that his parents and he contributed to the system that created their killer in the first place. Don't get me wrong, the other villains are villains as well, but they're created by the system that Wayne wants to remain in place.

GxM42 replied to Ren0x11 at 07/06/2022, 16:56:41 3 : How are you going after them?

Ren0x11 replied to GxM42 at 07/06/2022, 17:17:15 17 : A new class of 150,000+ apes. I am sure a good chunk of them will be very interested in getting involved in our institutions (local governments, state governments, federal governments, media, etc). Also many will have interest in taking serious legal action against many of these institutions and individuals. Our world has a very deeply rooted corruption/greed/tyranny problem. However, a bunch of good men/women with major “fuck you” money, could change the world.

Section-Fun replied to Ren0x11 at 07/06/2022, 18:00:53 1 : Do you not understand how much stock they also own? Hell, at the top they get a commission or percentage on every trade. There's no way you can catch them like this. Getting enough money to be solvent and free of wage based servitude is DELIGHTFUL, but the top is still the top and unless you exploit thousands of your employees you'll probably never see it.

We will be receiving new shares, not splitting the shares we already have. That is an important distinction when it comes to fucking hedgies!

[deleted user] replied to CapnKronsch at 07/06/2022, 14:36:59 1131 : That number always works somehow.  It's magic.

tnsmaster replied to [deleted user] at 07/06/2022, 15:58:01 27 : 7 is a truly magical number, just as the number 3 is so "perfect".

What is interesting to me is that 741 is not a prime number, so it must have been alluded to from the very beginning to be a split you didn't think was coming until you really thought about it.

I dunno. I'm rambling after work sucked me dry.

I'm actually totally the kind of guy and lucky enough to work in a place that I can transition to a position where no one cares how much or how little I do and keep the pay check as icing on the icing of the cake.

honeybadger1984 replied to tnsmaster at 07/06/2022, 19:01:18 4 : Nice.  Work income on the side, but you’ll be able to quit anytime you feel like.

tnsmaster replied to honeybadger1984 at 07/06/2022, 20:49:50 5 : Exactly. I'll be able to voice my concerns without fear due to my financial independence. There's too much safety and other concerns that need to be called out.
