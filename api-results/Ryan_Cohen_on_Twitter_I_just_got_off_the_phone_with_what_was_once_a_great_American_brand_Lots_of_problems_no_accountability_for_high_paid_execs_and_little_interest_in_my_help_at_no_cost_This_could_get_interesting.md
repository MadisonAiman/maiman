ImpiusEst replied to boxxle at 04/13/2023, 04:38:53 0 : Kinda yeah. He made a crazy amount of money on the BB&Beyond trade. It sounds like hes gonna do that again with another company.

My problem is just that the people who followed him into that stock are down so much. And it caused them to sell their GME.

boxxle replied to ImpiusEst at 04/13/2023, 04:58:24 6 : Couldn't be more wrong. The events that happened with towel didn't cause anyone to sell their GME. Get a hold of yourself.

Sounds like some executives might be opening themselves up to a shareholder lawsuit by not acting in the companies best interest

Edit: He would actually have $50,000,000 left over.

Positron49 replied to MrPoopieMcCuckface at 04/12/2023, 22:21:25 33 : There are two different statements:

In reference to GME, he was asked why Furlong was placed as CEO instead of himself.  He said he had done that sort of work at Chewy, and wasn‚Äôt interested in putting in the time into a single company like that again with his kids/family.  Instead he likes to play a higher/advisory role and let Furlong do his thing.

In reference to towel, he said he did not want to be on the board directly but wanted his representation there given he was busy with GME.
