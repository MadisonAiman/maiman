albino_red_head replied to lolyr at 04/16/2021, 15:23:45 1382 : this is the craziest, most confirmation bias inducing thing.  This is his final YOLO update, yes,  but he just fucking doubled down.  he not only excercised calls, but he bought $8million dollars more in shares than he already had.  WHY the fuck would he do that unless he had total fucking confidence that this thing was going to skyrocket.  thikn about it.  put an extra $8million dollars at risk of declining when he's aready a multi millionaire?  he has to know something we don't know (or do know and we've been tracking this shit properly the whole time!).   His tweets today had the theme of the big short, taking down financial institutions, taking off with big money.  I just have to think... he added more to his position not because he's unsure about what happens next, but that he's 1000% confident that this rocket ship is lifting off.

someone pointed out earlier that this is the same guy that is batting 1.000.  meaning, he impossibly but confidently has already beating all of the odds as though he's a time traveler and knows what happens next.  He got in at what, the all time bottom of $3/$4?  timed the January top to sell some shares (calls?) held a position and at the time of the trial doubled down his position at the absolute bottom.... and NOW he's doubled his position again?  holy shit.

Apprehensive-Use-703 replied to [deleted user] at 04/16/2021, 16:58:26 3 : The man is a master of memes, for the past week people were wondering if the # of tweets were a countdown, count up,  if minutes between was significant,  etc. If this is accurate 69/420, the man has forethought, planning and conviction unlike anyone I have ever seen before. It is truly incredible!

Edit: fuck.. I’m gonna leave the typo but y’all know who I’m talking about..

R-Kayde replied to Ghetto_Phenom at 04/16/2021, 16:48:49 169 : He 100% has to be the main character in the eventual movie about all this.

tidally_locked replied to R-Kayde at 04/16/2021, 18:12:42 26 : The movie title should simply be:

            DFV
A Gamestop Story
-Or-
 Gamestop
A DFV Story

Feel free to toss a Gamestop logo in there somewhere.

utopian_potential replied to tidally_locked at 04/17/2021, 01:10:14 4 : Gamestonk - Episode One: This Kitty's a menace

Gamestonk - Episode Two: Attack of the Ape's

mrprefecture replied to R-Kayde at 04/16/2021, 17:51:36 7 : What a move! Getting all his tendies from GME, in addition to the movie deals and books deals that will come his way! Once in a lifetime show of diamond balls!

TheCaptainCog replied to R-Kayde at 04/16/2021, 19:06:45 5 : Or they could do it Big Short Style with three different, interconnected perspectives. The DFV "retail" side, the HF side, and some other side I dunno. Movie peopel can figure that shit out

R-Kayde replied to TheCaptainCog at 04/16/2021, 20:12:35 1 : Yeah it will probably happen that way but in The Big Short Jared Vennett was technically the "main character" because he narrated the whole thing and al.ost everything was told from his perspective.

PeruvianHeadshrinker replied to TheCaptainCog at 04/19/2021, 09:50:30 1 : Regulators?

Ryan Cohen?

Jim Cramer (who loses his shit)?

Mark Cuban?

LassannnfromImgur replied to R-Kayde at 04/16/2021, 18:13:05 4 : He should portray himself.

Ghetto_Phenom replied to [deleted user] at 04/16/2021, 19:55:32 3 : Oh hands down.. I’m sure in a few years we’re gonna have a picture of him next to the definition of diamond hands

[deleted user] replied to Ghetto_Phenom at 04/16/2021, 20:21:55 2 : I’m pretty sure outside of Wall Street there will be a gorilla statue with a DFV head band as a monument against greed of these hedgefunds so they know their place in the future since this will be a prime price of financial history. And if not then that’s something we should all chip into as a community to make it happen

PeruvianHeadshrinker replied to [deleted user] at 04/19/2021, 09:52:07 2 : With hands cast in pure diamond.

albino_red_head replied to Ghetto_Phenom at 04/17/2021, 13:31:31 1 : I too have rapid surge in confidence while at the buffet.

PeruvianHeadshrinker replied to Ghetto_Phenom at 04/19/2021, 09:48:49 1 : I have this image now of Roaring Kitty in his sunglasses and sweats chowing down on King crab leg piled in front of him at the Belagio. Living the stonk life.

Mardanis replied to albino_red_head at 04/16/2021, 16:30:34 259 : He held when they hit 50 million, he held when they hit 17 million and he exercised and bought more when they at 34 million. There is an argument that he cannot lose for how cheap he got in but it speaks to the legend that he held and recommitted several times throughout the GME saga. Truly amazing.

albino_red_head replied to Mardanis at 04/16/2021, 17:42:18 87 : Oh, he could definitely lose. I mean, it takes a 90% drop to erase a 1000% gain.  He could theoretically see millions of dollars evaporate.  But his dimond balls and doubling down tells me: confidence.  And to my point, extreme confirmation bias.

PrestigeWrldWider replied to albino_red_head at 04/16/2021, 18:34:39 14 : This was my argument. Just because he quadrupled down doesn’t mean it’s going to rocket, it just means he still thinks it’s undervalued. He just likes the stock. It’ll rocket, I’m just pointing that out.

albino_red_head replied to PrestigeWrldWider at 04/16/2021, 19:06:13 11 : Yup, totally agree and that’s probably why I’m still here.  Confidence in my investment.  Squeeze or natural growth.  1 week, month, year, or 5, if I’m 37 and can retire by 42 I’m all in.

PrestigeWrldWider replied to albino_red_head at 04/16/2021, 19:39:16 12 : The irony is the negative beta. Seemingly, in the case of the unavoidable correction of the the market and banks going tits up, GME turns out to be one of the safest places to keep your money. 😂

Nix-7c0 replied to PrestigeWrldWider at 04/16/2021, 20:53:04 6 : Agreed - check out that "Home Alone" parody he made as an example. It really seems to convey the message that he's not waiting on a squeeze, he's expecting its fundamental value to climb past where it was on that first squeeze.

PrestigeWrldWider replied to Nix-7c0 at 04/16/2021, 21:34:36 2 : I know not of which you speak.

Nix-7c0 replied to PrestigeWrldWider at 04/17/2021, 00:55:02 3 : https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1376927312390787073?s=20

Seems more significant because it was actually edited together with a story and message

PrestigeWrldWider replied to Nix-7c0 at 04/17/2021, 06:36:37 2 : And on my birthday. He’s just the sweetest.

[deleted user] replied to Mardanis at 04/17/2021, 02:41:21 2 : When the MOASS hits $10m/share (floor), he’ll be a Trillionaire... after taxes!

Steel-Ape-Trader replied to Mardanis at 04/17/2021, 03:33:20 2 : For sure man, he's destined for the moon and nowhere else.

thepoga replied to albino_red_head at 04/16/2021, 15:42:26 242 : Maybe he doesn’t know anything extra we don’t know. He just likes the stock? 

Haha but honestly, he has his thesis, and if he believes in it, if he believes they haven’t covered, why not put more in?

Tweak3n replied to thepoga at 04/16/2021, 16:07:05 92 : Gamestop has a bright future anyway. Squeeze is just a cherry on top

lvotis1 replied to Tweak3n at 04/17/2021, 14:32:42 1 : That gonna be one hell of a fucking cherry LOL

MoreCamThanRon replied to thepoga at 04/16/2021, 15:48:00 170 : The clue is in the name: he's a value investor

Lunarsprint replied to MoreCamThanRon at 04/16/2021, 15:58:07 75 : Pretty sure he'd own GameStop without the squeeze, the squeeze and wrecking corrupt, unlawful, crony, sleezey, dbag, hedgefunds is just a super sweet  unobtainium cherry on top.

LivinTHighLife replied to Lunarsprint at 04/16/2021, 19:18:12 2 : This. It’s a 1-2k per share in the next year or 2 without a squeeze.

Lunarsprint replied to LivinTHighLife at 04/16/2021, 20:53:49 0 : Thats more optimistic than my figuring I was thinking $640ps w/in 4years by looking at chewy and consolidating their current share price into a similar # of shares. At a share avg of what $60 max that's a guaranteed 10x a fucking grandslam in the world series. this squeeze goes off he be the fucking God Emperor of the fucking universe. 10m is not a meme means he'll blow the fucking doors off of being the first trillionair he'll be the richest Liquid assets mofo after taxes, likely to never be touched by any single person, and blackrock will own the planet if they sell at 10m. Most of us will be top 2-3% in comparison. the only way I see this doesn't zero out the world is if USD goes .001 or less of current value so ^hodl ^like ^your ^fucking ^lives ^depend ^on ^it ^cause ^it ^might we might be heading for crazy conspiracy land post squeeze, and God knows the only thing governments respect is fuckin dollar bills y'all.

I'm a smoothish brained ape who is excited, and fucking terrified of what comes after, if you take financial advice your stealing.

P.S. I won't be wasting food and ammo any time soon, sorry for the black cloud word vomit apes these are concerns that have been festering since 08 bail outs. at first I was writing fun then "the numbers Mason, the numbers what do they mean" started up.

PPS mods feel free to delete this once I wrote it I couldn't delete it. In fact please do anyone wanting to continue this can DM me

ThisWillBeFunNA replied to thepoga at 04/16/2021, 17:10:53 7 : And lets be honest, GME is going to be worth 300$/share or more easily with or without a squeeze. Its a no brainer to buy more at the current price.
