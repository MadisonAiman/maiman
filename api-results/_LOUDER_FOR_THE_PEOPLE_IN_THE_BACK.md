EveryoneAnonymous commented at 10/26/2021, 13:49:35 2750 : A system that can be brought down by simply buying and holding a stock, is a faulty system. It shows how the big boys have always been familiar with the rules of the game, where main street would simply buy and sell quickly for either a small profit or a loss until apes came in and started realizing the true power of hodling en masse.

We are the change, we are learning what game they have been playing and we are not playing by those rules, WE ARE CHANGING THOSE RULES.

BUY.HODL.DRS.

honeybadger1984 replied to ResolutionHorror541 at 10/26/2021, 15:13:54 266 : They are calling us manipulators by discussing online.  In reality it’s just them gaslighting. Buying and holding is not manipulation.  And DRS is our right as it’s our property.  DRS is the only way to have true ownership.

lemontortilla replied to honeybadger1984 at 10/26/2021, 17:13:20 136 : They collude at fancy dinners and meetings. So why is this any different? Well here is why. 

None of us have any true insider knowledge like they do. We don’t have millions to billions of dollars to manipulate prices. We don’t have friends at other institutions to get a whisper of what’s to come. We don’t even get to see price changes and transaction at the same speeds they do

We are a bunch of smooth-brains who just like the stock. Acting individually but celebrating together. Yet somehow we are still butt-fucking them collectively. And they don’t like it.

Extra-Computer6303 replied to honeybadger1984 at 10/26/2021, 17:42:39 38 : Nothing about buying and holding is manipulation. However, by buying holding and registering shares, the chronic manipulation of the system by market makers, SHFs and brokerages is coming to the surface and seeing the light of day. Wall Street is dirty and it’s time to start sweeping.

This, for me, is the most important of All, and for that, I can thanks not only to my friendship of Ape bros, but, to be fair, tho the "investor" for excellence, Warren Buffet, yes he and Charles always predicated they seek the "Value" of the company, and buy only what they can comprehend the business model and, Hold for decades or forever.

Apes took this to aAnother Level, with faith in two mans, DFV and RC to look not at what the company value was until then, but for what will be in the next future, the HFs and WallStreet bad boys (in collution with MSM) want only profit of any retail investor dumbing any company in bad financials or bad times to ease their shitty games played with rules specially formulated for their beneficial. 

Hopefully, Soon we apes will Moon and gives to thesr bad actors finally what they Deserve, jail and food stamps, the Lambos will be for them a dream of the past.

Manipulated Stock Market, I bet, him DRS every share his company own, and thats what we apes will do, HODL our beloved stonk GME in a way no fucking HFucks can screw us, no more. The Time is coming...tic, tac, tic, tac...

The Simple thing "companies can't talk to their shareholders or asking or promoting the public about DRS" is a Very Crime. The system is Ridged and NEED to BE Reset,

LegalBegQuestion replied to EveryoneAnonymous at 10/26/2021, 15:36:34 280 : A system that can be upended by individuals choosing to INVEST rather than TRADE securities, is not the underpinning of society it claims to be. 

I think this is the biggest point people fail to hammer home- apes are choosing to INVEST in a company they believe in. HFs/Institutions/firms etc are losing their minds because apes are not trading the way they need them to. Trading being the economic driver would mean that the companies and employees and supplies/materials are not the important piece in the puzzle- just the back and forth for pennies, dollars, ups and downs. 

The stock market is NOT the economy. 

People purchasing goods and paying for services, spending their earned income in places which hire other people and pay them a wages which can then be used to purchase goods and services- that is the economy. 

Wall Street forgot that.

Investor_Pikachu replied to EveryoneAnonymous at 10/26/2021, 16:10:45 54 : Let me point out the difference between us apes and the shitty hedgefund institutions such as Shitadel:

Us apes are INVESTING in companies that we support and believe in, which helps those vested companies grow through additional funding they receive. We do this by BUYING AND HOLDING THE STOCK. This is exactly what the stock market is primarily used for, and we apes are doing just that.

Hedgefunds such as Shitadel abuse the stock market as if it was some casino they control. They short companies into bankruptcy by borrowing shares they don't own. At the very extreme, they borrow shares over an amount THAT DON'T EXIST! This is solely done to make a quick profit at the expense of the companies they are shorting against, which is exactly the opposite of what the stock market is intended for.

In short, us apes invest in the stock market by buying and holding shares AS WE LOVE THE STOCK. Shitty hedgefunds abuse the stock market as if it's their casino.

gustoreddit51 replied to Investor_Pikachu at 10/26/2021, 18:27:06 2 : Most of the apes I know are day traders with a computer and shit like E-Trade trying to make some money thinking they're as smart as a brokerage traders. 

"Buy & hold" is by no means new and is really just old school  stock investing  that older people are very familiar with.  One buys value (ala Ben Graham),  growth, income, or, in many cases, hope and wishful thinking.

HulksInvinciblePants replied to _Syfex_ at 10/26/2021, 15:55:44 1 : I can't count the number of people that were warning users about Robinhood's ability to maintain compliance. Perhaps the barrier of entry to start a brokerage should be higher, but then people would complain about monopolies. Either way, there were ignored red flags.

nfwiqefnwof replied to HulksInvinciblePants at 10/26/2021, 16:16:04 1 : How about brokers lending out your shares? Or better yet, brokers not even bothering to go to the exchange at all with your order? It's broken so far beyond just turning off the buy button.
