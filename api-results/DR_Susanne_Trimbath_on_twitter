lil_bopeep replied to Toomanykidstosupport at 11/15/2022, 17:11:43 141 : They're either

A ) not educated enough of the reality that they're being ruthlessly stolen from at every step of the way (broker, market maker, DTCC, etc) 

B) paid off to say things 

C) afraid of tax consequences 

I see people make arguments for "the broker shares are the MOASS shares" and "you really think a broker will lose your shares or not honour them..? Come on bro" 

I mean, if an entire nation can go bankrupt and take their people's money, why wouldn't a broker or bank be able to? I dunno, I just don't trust it. Why subject yourself to PFOF, FTDs, stock lending, not voting your shares? You buy something, you should get it no?

Toomanykidstosupport replied to youdoitimbusy at 11/15/2022, 18:14:47 37 : Agreed. And on the broker side don’t forget the vast number of brokers whom shut off the buy button. That alone should be enough to encourage drsing; but then you have all the other reasons on top of that. I just don’t get it. Anyways, back to the kids - ya know - cuz there are too many.

Just so you know, BMO is free to DRS. I set up an account exactly for this purpose

Cdn_Brown_Recluse replied to lil_bopeep at 11/16/2022, 03:53:28 2 : I will look into it today.

Infamous_Bill2360 replied to lil_bopeep at 11/15/2022, 18:27:44 12 : The biggest reason to me is they're selling CC's to make money on their failed cycle pumps with their YT followings "dO YoUr OwN rEsEaRcH" but buy these calls because GaMmA iS rAmPiNg LoOk"....gherk dbag nursegingerlips dbag that whole selfish side of this preaches against DRS'ing because options don't exist when shares are in your name....im all for options but not with GME....DRS your shares if you can is all that matters.

Lurking_Still replied to Infamous_Bill2360 at 11/15/2022, 20:44:06 -4 : I love selling CC's on my shares. I'll just buy more if they get assigned. Literally, I can just reinvest the premiums as more shares.

Lurking_Still replied to Infamous_Bill2360 at 11/15/2022, 20:53:18 -1 : All my shares are in my Roth, so buying and selling repeatedly with ever increasing numbers is only to my benefit? Why should I care if someone buy the shares I have for more than I paid for them?

I'll just buy cash secured puts to reenter my long position...and sell more covered calls.

I don't hate DRS. I just like money.

Infamous_Bill2360 replied to Lurking_Still at 11/15/2022, 20:55:24 3 : That’s ironic. Do you.

Altruistic-Beyond223 replied to Lurking_Still at 11/15/2022, 20:56:24 4 : Good luck. I'm not going to risk losing my shares during MOASS, it could be tomorrow. Especially if everyone decided to just buy from Computershare instead of a brokerage while APEs at brokerages DRS. If more shares leave the DTCC than go in, I would image that would lead to efficient price discovery.

Lurking_Still replied to Altruistic-Beyond223 at 11/15/2022, 21:02:56 -1 : I'm super not worried about it, I'm going to keep making money each week.

If they get assigned, it'll be for more than I paid, plus all the premiums I've collected.

Altruistic-Beyond223 replied to Lurking_Still at 11/15/2022, 21:23:22 4 : Yeah, I think it's time to set up a recurring buy on CS instead of buying through a brokerage.

Toomanykidstosupport replied to ImFriendsWithThatGuy at 11/16/2022, 07:42:45 2 : Dunno tbh. That’s the exciting part. But I believe there are ways to drs a Roth if you are interested

Gritty_Resilience commented at 11/15/2022, 14:15:14 481 : Does intermediary mean/= anything other than Computershare/DRS?

mtgac replied to Gritty_Resilience at 11/15/2022, 19:48:53 197 : Welcome those of you from the front page.  

Intermediary in this sense means Stock Broker like Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.   

There are many transfer agents.  Computershare is the transfer agent for GameStop (GME).  GameStop's stock, GME, is the primary focus of this sub.  

Buying stock directly from the transfer agent hits the lit market, bypasses the brokers, and registers the stock in your name.  Stock purchased through brokers is not actually held in your name, might not come from the lit market, may be purchased from dark pools, or may just be counterfeit shares entirely.  

Transferring your shares from
a broker to the transfer agent ensures that even shares that was originally counterfeit are real and registered in your name.

OxytocinOD replied to mtgac at 11/15/2022, 20:02:32 44 : Excellent summary

snowlock27 replied to mtgac at 11/15/2022, 20:52:50 10 : > bypasses the brokers

ComputerShare uses brokers to buy and sell shares.

Tac_Reso replied to snowlock27 at 11/15/2022, 22:53:23 3 : I'm guessing they mean market makers rather, but the idea is solid regardless.

Ghostclip replied to snowlock27 at 11/15/2022, 23:24:36 2 : Yes, but the fact remains those shares can no longer be loaned or used against you in any shape, form or fashion.

MarVanDam replied to Gritty_Resilience at 11/15/2022, 18:35:35 26 : Buying anywhere besides Computershare and IEX keeps them in the game.

Simple_Piccolo replied to Gritty_Resilience at 11/15/2022, 15:47:08 -83 : Yep. It doesn't matter if you DRS after buying from Fudelity. Buying from Fudelity is giving them every money / chairs.   


NFA: Just the opinion of some random asshole on the internet.

Theoretical_Action replied to Simple_Piccolo at 11/15/2022, 15:59:43 131 : Let's rephrase that one big chief. It absolutely matters if you DRS after buying via Fidelity. It's *better* to buy direct from CS but let's absolutely universally unequivocally **refrain** from dissuading people to DRS shares bought elsewhere. Doing so gives the hedge funds a little more oxygen to stay alive a little longer, but they are going to be shot with a bazooka once the float is locked up anyways so any way you can acquire shares and DRS them is fine. DRS and lock the float is, and always will be, the play. Buying direct from CS is, again, always better but if you can't do that or don't want to move your money around to do so, buying from brokers and DRSing is still perfectly fine. 

Not financial advice

z430 replied to Theoretical_Action at 11/15/2022, 16:44:01 23 : Buying form a broker actually gives you more control on the purchase price (using limit orders), with computershare you unfortunately do not have this option (you front up the funds and wait around 2 days for them to execute). 

In the end, so long as broker shares are DRS’d then the result is the same (give or take a few shares depending on the purchase price at time of execution)

In my view the most effective purchase route is through a broker using IEX (with an order of 100 shares or more to actually have a chance of moving the price) and the DRS’ing right after trade settlement. 

All routes point to DRS.. each of us can decide how to reach that point if we so wish

DancesWith2Socks replied to z430 at 11/15/2022, 16:53:31 13 : >through a broker using IEX ~~(with an order of 100 shares or more to actually have a chance of moving the price)~~ and the DRS’ing right after trade settlement.

Agree :) (crossing out that part for poor apes, like myself).

Simple_Piccolo replied to Theoretical_Action at 11/15/2022, 17:09:55 -22 : That's cool. Keep giving them new chairs to reset their obligations. You do you!

Theoretical_Action replied to Simple_Piccolo at 11/15/2022, 17:16:03 11 : You have no idea what you're talking about.

Simple_Piccolo replied to Theoretical_Action at 11/15/2022, 18:33:09 -5 : I guess neither does Dr. Trimbath because that's specifically what she said in the tweet.

"Like any Ponzi Scheme: they keep working as long as new money is coming in. When investors (you) insist on buying shares directly from issuers (Gamestop/Computershare), without intermediaries (Fidelity, TDAmeritrade, any broker, etc), the music stops."

If you use an intermediary, you're just giving them more chairs to play with. Even if you eventually take the chair away, they still got to use it to delay being eliminated. So yea, keep buying from Fudelity and keep giving them more time with the music.

Again. NFA. Just my opinion.

Theoretical_Action replied to Simple_Piccolo at 11/15/2022, 18:45:42 5 : The music stops when the float is locked you goober. Nothing they do can delay that. If you think otherwise, feel free to elaborate *exactly* how buying through a broker will prevent MOASS after the float is locked. Because your initial comment literally said 

>It doesn't matter if you DRS after buying from Fudelity. 

That is the full sentence, unedited. That is a misleading thing to say, period, and just reads like FUD about DRSing which is dumb as fuck.

ronaldduckjr replied to Theoretical_Action at 11/15/2022, 19:17:22 6 : Upvoted for goober

Altruistic-Beyond223 replied to Theoretical_Action at 11/15/2022, 20:44:32 1 : We know we need to direct register our shares to protect our investment. But maybe Dr. T is right. Maybe brokerages are somehow using new shares to reset FTDs? I'm not sure, but I think Dr. T chose her words carefully. I think I might actually only buy from CS from now on. If no new shares go in, and shares only come out, maybe that's the balance that needs to be upset?

But if we want to see MOASS, maybe all there needs to be are more shares leaving the DTCC than that which go in, which stops the music?

RubberBootsInMotion replied to thefr3shprince at 11/15/2022, 17:01:58 9 : Some people want to have their cake and eat it too. 

Or this is a bot pushing the sentiment that resulted in brokers existing in the first place.

n0xx_is_irish replied to thefr3shprince at 11/15/2022, 17:02:12 5 : 1.	Buy from broker at the price you want
2.	DRS the shares, forcing them to actually locate
3.	Profit?

thefr3shprince replied to n0xx_is_irish at 11/15/2022, 17:07:42 8 : It’s not as simple as that for many brokers though. 

GME price has been bouncing around 25-30 since for a while, you’d probably save more waiting for CS to locate a share for you than to pay your broker (my broker charges $300 for example) to DRS your shares.

Simple_Piccolo replied to thefr3shprince at 11/15/2022, 17:12:58 6 : IMO he basically says:  


1. Buy from a broker at the price you want.
2. Let the broker  help a HF reset their FTD obligations keeping the game of fraud alive
3. DRS the shares after doing the hedge funds a favor
4. Profit

Altruistic-Beyond223 replied to Simple_Piccolo at 11/15/2022, 21:05:59 1 : So you're saying the new shares can somehow reset FTDs, and if retail only buys from the issuer, the brokerage will get the money yes, but not the "fresh shares" that could be used for fukery? Basically, buy straight from Computershare if you want efficient price discovery.

BornLuckiest replied to Nameis-RobertPaulson at 11/15/2022, 17:21:25 1 : Your broker you transferred them from will offer you a spot price to receive them back... You'll have a price within minutes.

Nameis-RobertPaulson replied to BornLuckiest at 11/15/2022, 18:10:11 1 : I mean for direct buys (not sells) through CS, unless I'm wrong, you can't place specific market orders, only BUY X.

BornLuckiest replied to Nameis-RobertPaulson at 11/15/2022, 18:15:55 1 : If it's a direct purchase make sure you have at least 1 shared transferred from a broker, a better than average one of possible. 

Even though they only took out 1 share, they'll happily buy back any you want to transfer back into the DTCC at the current spot price... Even if you want to sell several million dollars worth.

Coach_GordonBombay replied to Nameis-RobertPaulson at 11/15/2022, 18:20:07 0 : And the difference between $0.5-1 per share is worth it to you?  I would bet most times people get a better price since noboduly can time the market.

Coach_GordonBombay replied to Simple_Piccolo at 11/15/2022, 18:31:24 3 : Only because the broker collects a fee, but they arent able to give an IOU.  They have to immediately go get you a share to DRS.

doctorplasmatron replied to azidesandamides at 11/15/2022, 19:03:26 2 : i think it stems from a misunderstood attempt by my canadian credit union to try and set up an american account for me so I could buy directly, this was 84 years ago before i got wise.  so my credit union was trying to help me, it didn't work out, and computershare is thinking there might be shenanigans at hand.  That's my best guess as they won't tell me anything about the error.

i've explained many times to the phone room, i have emailed, i have submitted the online forms, i have complied with all their requests but i still can't continue investing through Computershare, according to my last contact.

it's not like we're talking big numbers here either, i buy in single digits if/when i can.

doctorplasmatron replied to BigBradWolf77 at 11/16/2022, 23:07:05 2 : ka-chow!

...update: I got a reply from the Ombudsman in Canada and they're willing to look into it, peerhaps since Computershare is also a 'participant' in Canada?

So I sent another email query to CS about my account and waiting to hear back, if I get nothing in a week I'll forward all communications to Ombudsman and see where to go from there.

EDIT: update!  It seems mentioning the magic word "Ombudsman" might have helped, as I just got an email from CS's "financial crimes" division saying the locks on my accounts have been removed. I decided to test this statement this morning by putting a direct buy order in and so far so good!  Next up will be DRS'ing the remainder of shares I accumulated at my Shitty Broker while all this was going on.  So, lesson learned is: perseverance furthers, and Ombudsmen seem to get respect.  

I just wish Computershare's customer-facing service was a little more willing to work with problems and less "sorry I can't help you and can't forward you to someone who can.", it shouldn't take months to get to an email exchange that can make any progress.
