When asked why the CEO still got a raise they said, "It looks good to shareholders to give the CEO a raise because it means he's doing a good job. It would be suspicious if he didn't get annual raises." Like, eff off with that bs.

"The workers? They can learn to sew if they need clothes."

So we got one rich bozo who sits there with his thumb up his ass, while the rest of the factory is dressed in rags. What a great look! Dumping my money in!

On the other hand, 12% raise for RC doesn't sound bad. I am up for it (12% of zero is still zero though).

DannyFnKay replied to acart005 at 09/28/2023, 07:57:47 48 : ## When we think of Fortune 500 CEOs, we imagine the companies' most highly paid employees. But in a few cases, CEOs are actually the worst-paid people on staff.

Tesla ([TSLA](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&source=story_quote_link)) announced Thursday that CEO Elon Musk [took home $0 last year](https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/23/news/companies/elon-musk-tesla-pay/index.html?iid=EL). No cash. No stock. (Technically, Tesla offered him a minimum wage salary of $35,360, but Musk never cashed the checks.)

Musk is in very exclusive company. Whole Foods' (WFM) John Mackey, Google's ([GOOGL](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GOOGL&source=story_quote_link)) Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Facebook's ([FB](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FB&source=story_quote_link)) Mark Zuckerberg, National Instruments' ([NATI](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NATI&source=story_quote_link)) James Truchard and Kinder Morgan's ([KMI](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=KMI&source=story_quote_link)) Richard Kinder all took home exactly $1 last year.

That's assuming they actually cashed their $1 checks. When he was mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg made a point not to cash his $1 checks. (Actually, they were for 93 cents after Social Security and Medicare payments were taken out).

The $1 salaries became a popular statement for the country's top government officials and some CEOs to make during World War I and World War II. They took the nominal $1 salary instead of $0, because it's [illegal to volunteer services](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1342) for the government unless in a time of emergency.

Today, there are more than a [dozen CEOs who make a salary of just $1 a year](https://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/companies/2013/08/06/one-dollar-salaries/index.html?iid=EL). But the vast majority are also paid in stock options and grants.

[**Related: CEOs who get paid $1**](https://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/companies/2013/08/06/one-dollar-salaries/index.html?iid=EL)

For example, former Oracle CEO Larry Ellison took home just a $1 salary, but he was routinely the highest-paid CEO in the world. In 2013, he earned $65.7 million (plus one dollar). Activist investor Carl Icahn, Sears CEO Eddie Lampert and HP CEO Meg Whitman were among some of the other handsomely paid $1 CEOs last year.

Some CEOs opt to take payment in stock rather than salary to make a symbolic gesture: their pay is tied to the performance of the company.

That's why American Airlines ([AAL](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAL&source=story_quote_link)) CEO Doug Parker announced Thursday that he would no longer accept a salary.

"I believe this is the right way for my compensation to be set -- at risk, based entirely on the results achieved, and in the same currency that our shareholders receive," he said in a letter to employees.

Taking a $1 salary also means CEOs pay lower taxes. Income over $413,200 is taxed at 39.6% (the highest federal tax bracket), but capital gains taxes are just 20%. That's why billionaire Warren Buffett made a big stink a few years ago about [paying a lower tax rate than his secretary](http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/?iid=EL).

A common thread that binds the *true* $1 CEOs is that they are also millionaire or billionaire founders of their companies who hold a tremendous amount of stock in their businesses. Their fortunes are also tied to the company's performance -- but they already have so much skin in the game that they can afford not to take any additional payment at all. They already made their millions or billions from their companies' public stock offerings.

Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, owns or controls nearly 62% of Facebook shares' votes. Brin and Page collectively control 55.7% of votes for Google's shares. Adding more shares would only pad their portfolios somewhat -- not their influence or dependence on the company's growth.

The one notable exception was former Apple ([AAPL](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&source=story_quote_link)) CEO Steve Jobs. He owned 5.5 million shares of Apple at the time of his death in 2011 -- just a half percent of Apple's outstanding shares. Yet he [took a $1 salary](http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2011/technology/1111/gallery.1_dollar_tech_executives/?iid=EL) with no bonus or stock grants.

MarkMoneyj27 replied to DannyFnKay at 09/28/2023, 11:49:34 8 : Also, anyone who runs a company knows this is complete BS.  We buy all our shit with company money, pay ourselves $1 to avoid income tax.  Easily one of the biggest bait and switches there is to really make normals believe we are good humans for taking no money out.

Need a Hampton house?  Company.  Need 4 wheelers?  Company.  Boat?  Company.  Restaurants, company.  Then I pay myself $1 and the fed actually sends me money, it's bullshit.


I don't actually do this, it was just easier to explain using me as an example.  I do own a corporation though.

Is he the only CEO that you know of? Cause this is a very common thing that CEO‚Äôs do. Why talk so confidently out of your ass when you‚Äôre so wrong? There‚Äôs even a wiki page of it‚Ä¶. And even still it‚Äôs missing tons of CEO‚Äôs that have done this. It‚Äôs not altruistic at all, they still get paid millions in stock options and performance bonuses against how the stock performs. Not sure if that‚Äôs what Ryan is doing or not, but still.

hiyori replied to Unethical-Sloth at 09/28/2023, 07:05:38 3 : This is not true at all. He was directly compensated from the company via options based on achievement. He received most of his wealth from *these* awards. Ryan Cohen is not getting stock from the company for free (or achievement as Elon)-- but he is BUYING at market price.

Elon also only made 175m from Paypal and most of that was spent on spacex/tesla startup.
